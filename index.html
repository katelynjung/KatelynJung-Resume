        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business Administrationüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> My name is Katelyn Jung and I am 18 years old. I am a freshman at the University of California, Riverside and I am currently taking four courses. I am taking English 001B, CS008, Intro to Business, and ARC 35. I'm determined to earn my MBA so I plan on applying for graduate school. I plan to work hard at the Univeristy of California, Riverside and successfuly graduate in 2025. I hope to earn a business management job at a large company. I prefer Netflix, Disney, or Google as they are well known and reputable corporations with large employee benefits. To obtain such a prestigious job, I plan to partake in many internships throughout my undergraduate years to further make connections. Business is all about connections so I plan on joining a business fraternity here on campus as well. Hopefully by joining a community with the same goals as me, I will be introduced to people with different work ethics and ideas to branch out my skills. So far, I‚Äôve participated in some business activities by volunteering!
 <br><br>

        I‚Äôve volunteered at the Discovery Science Cube in Santa Ana, California where I tended children through the science exhibits. I volunteered for about 5 months but earned 40 hours on top of my rigorous schooling. Through this volunteership, I was able to learn valuable lessons such as patience and how to properly communicate with people higher up than me and also how to interact with consumers. I believe with this important asset, I will be beneficial to corporations as I have good communication skills which is one of the most crucial aspects of a good business person.  <br><br>

        Another business I have partaken in is selling toe-shoes! As my sister participated in gymnastics, it was vital for her to have a constant supply of toe shoes to dance. To ease the financial burden on my family, I decided to invest and resell. Toe shoes alone cost $40 per pair, and gymnasts like Hannah easily go through a pair every week. As Rhythmic Gymnastics is an uncommon sport, finding quality shoes is a challenge.  After many hours spent scouring the web in search of a solution, I came across a sustainable and ethical European company that sold quality toe shoes in bulk. Researching ‚ÄúDvillena,‚Äù  I learned that it was a reputable supplier that provided shoes to many National Team members. I wanted to let our Rhythmic Gymnastics community know about my discovery and decided to do so through my launch of a new business enterprise during my sophomore year. I reached out to ‚ÄúDvillena‚Äù and secured permission to purchase the shoes for resale at wholesale prices. After applying for and receiving a business license, I started ‚ÄúHigh Releve,‚Äù my own business enterprise. To maximize exposure, I organized a booth at various competitions and started selling toe shoes. While providing a valuable service to our tight-knit gymnastics community, I sold my product for lower than half full retail. Quickly, my clientele grew to include significant athletes, even Olympians and National team members! With my modest profits, I created a scholarship fund for needy athletes at Hannah‚Äôs gym.
